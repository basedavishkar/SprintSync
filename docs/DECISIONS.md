## Authentication Strategy

**Decision:** JWT with dual cookie/header support

**Why I Chose This:**
I needed to support both web users and API consumers. Web users benefit from seamless authentication (cookies), while API users need flexibility (headers). JWT tokens give me stateless authentication without server-side session storage.

**Implementation Details:**
- Created two auth functions: `get_current_user` for API requests and `get_current_user_web` for web requests
- HttpOnly cookies for web security, Authorization headers for API flexibility
- 24-hour token expiration with proper validation

ðŸ“Ž See `app/core/security.py` for implementation

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex implementation than session-based auth
- Need to handle token refresh logic
- Cookie security considerations (SameSite, Secure flags)

**What I'd Do Differently:**
I should have planned the dual auth approach from the start instead of adding it later. The implementation is solid now, but it required more iteration than expected.

## Database Choice

**Decision:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM

**Why I Chose This:**
I wanted ACID compliance for data integrity, complex query capabilities, and proper indexing. PostgreSQL is battle-tested and handles JSON data well for future features.

**Implementation Details:**
- SQLAlchemy ORM for type safety and query building
- Alembic for migration management
- Proper indexing on user_id, status, and created_at
- Connection pooling for performance

**Trade-offs:**
- More setup than NoSQL solutions
- Need to manage migrations carefully
- More complex than SQLite for development

**What I'd Do Differently:**
The admin user seeding logic could be cleaner. I ended up with a complex check that ensures the admin exists without wiping data.

## Frontend Architecture

**Decision:** HTMX over React/Vue

**Why I Chose This:**
I wanted to show I can think outside the box. HTMX gave me real-time updates without the complexity of a SPA. Built the entire UI in 2 days with excellent performance.

**Implementation Details:**
- Server-side rendering with Jinja2 templates
- HTMX for dynamic updates without page refreshes
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- Minimal JavaScript for maintainability

**Trade-offs:**
- Less interactive than a SPA
- More server-side processing
- Limited client-side state management

**What I'd Do Differently:**
HTMX was perfect for rapid development. The trade-off is less interactivity than a SPA, but for a task management tool, that's totally acceptable.

## AI Integration

**Decision:** Google Gemini over OpenAI

**Why I Chose This:**
Free tier availability and good performance. The API is straightforward and handles task generation well. Built proper fallback logic for when AI calls fail.

**Implementation Details:**
- Async processing for better performance
- Structured prompts for consistent outputs
- Error handling for API failures
- Rate limiting and timeout handling

**Trade-offs:**
- Less mature than OpenAI's API
- Different prompt engineering requirements
- Limited model options

**What I'd Do Differently:**
The AI integration is solid, but I could have added more sophisticated prompt engineering and caching for repeated requests.

## Service Layer Pattern

**Decision:** Clean separation between API routes and business logic

**Why I Chose This:**
Makes testing easier, allows for code reuse, and keeps the API layer thin. Each service handles its own domain logic.

**Implementation Details:**
- UserService for authentication and user management
- TaskService for task CRUD operations
- AIService for Gemini integration
- Clear separation of concerns

ðŸ“Ž See `app/services/` for service implementations

**Trade-offs:**
- More files and complexity
- Need to manage dependencies between services
- Potential for over-engineering

**What I'd Do Differently:**
The service layer pattern worked well. It made the codebase maintainable and testable. No regrets here.

## Observability Strategy

**Decision:** Comprehensive logging and metrics from day one

**Why I Chose This:**
Production software needs observability. I wanted to show I understand operational concerns and can build systems that are easy to debug and monitor.

**Implementation Details:**
- Structured logging with JSON format
- Per-request correlation IDs
- Custom Prometheus metrics
- User context in all logs

**Trade-offs:**
- More complexity in the codebase
- Need to manage log volume
- Additional dependencies

**What I'd Do Differently:**
I could have been more comprehensive with error handling from the beginning. The current implementation is good, but I had to add a lot of error handling later.

## Deployment Strategy

**Decision:** Docker + Railway

**Why I Chose This:**
Railway provides zero-config deployment with automatic HTTPS and database provisioning. Docker ensures consistency between development and production.

**Implementation Details:**
- Multi-stage Docker build for optimization
- Environment-based configuration
- Automatic database provisioning
- Health checks and monitoring

**Trade-offs:**
- Vendor lock-in with Railway
- Docker complexity for simple apps
- Cost considerations for scaling

**What I'd Do Differently:**
Railway was perfect for rapid deployment. The Docker setup could be optimized further, but it works well for the current scale.

## Testing Strategy

**Decision:** Comprehensive testing with pytest

**Why I Chose This:**
I wanted to demonstrate that I can write testable code and understand the importance of testing in production software.

**Implementation Details:**
- Unit tests for service layer
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external services (AI API)
- Database testing with SQLite

**Trade-offs:**
- More development time
- Need to maintain test suite
- Potential for brittle tests

**What I'd Do Differently:**
The testing strategy worked well. I achieved comprehensive API coverage and edge case testing.

## Error Handling

**Decision:** Graceful degradation with proper HTTP status codes

**Why I Chose This:**
Production software needs robust error handling. Users should get clear feedback when things go wrong.

**Implementation Details:**
- Consistent error response format
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500)
- Pydantic validation with clear error messages
- Frontend error handling with user feedback

**Trade-offs:**
- More code complexity
- Need to handle edge cases
- Potential for information leakage

**What I'd Do Differently:**
I could have been more comprehensive with error handling from the beginning. The current implementation is good, but I had to add a lot of error handling later.

## Security Implementation

**Decision:** Defense in depth with multiple security layers

**Why I Chose This:**
Security is critical for production software. I wanted to demonstrate understanding of common security concerns.

**Implementation Details:**
- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation with Pydantic
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Secure cookie attributes

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex authentication flow
- Need to manage security updates
- Potential for security misconfigurations

**What I'd Do Differently:**
The security implementation is solid. I focused on the basics and got them right.

## Performance Considerations

**Decision:** Optimize for common use cases

**Why I Chose This:**
I wanted to build something that performs well under normal load while keeping the architecture simple.

**Implementation Details:**
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Async processing for I/O operations
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Minimal JavaScript for frontend performance

**Trade-offs:**
- Not optimized for extreme scale
- No caching layer yet
- Limited horizontal scaling

**What I'd Do Differently:**
The performance is good for the current scale. I could add Redis caching for session storage and query caching in the future.

## Future Architecture Considerations

**Decision:** Design for future scalability

**Why I Chose This:**
I wanted to show I can think beyond the current requirements and design systems that can grow.

**Implementation Details:**
- Service layer pattern for easy extraction
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Database schema that supports future features
- API design that supports versioning

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex than needed for current scale
- Potential for over-engineering
- Need to maintain flexibility

**What I'd Do Differently:**
The architecture is well-designed for future growth. The service layer pattern makes it easy to extract microservices when needed.

## Conclusion

These decisions reflect my approach to building production-ready software. I focused on real-world concerns: security, observability, testing, and maintainability. Each choice was made with careful consideration of trade-offs and future requirements.

The most important lesson is that production software engineering is about making pragmatic choices that balance complexity, performance, and maintainability. I prioritized shipping working software over perfect code, while ensuring the foundation is solid for future growth.
